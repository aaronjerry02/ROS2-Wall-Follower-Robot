# ROS2-Wall-Follower-Robot
ROS2 wall-following robot built in The Constructâ€™s ROS2 Basics course. Uses topics to read laser scan and odometry data, a service to find and align with a wall, and an action to monitor distance and report lap completion. Uses reentrant callbacks for concurrency; tested in simulation and on a real robot in Barcelona.
